00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:10.400
 O'Driscoll:
  Hello everyone and welcome! My name is Michael O'Driscoll, and I'm a professor

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.669
 O'Driscoll:
  of English at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada and a governing

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.940
 O'Driscoll:
  board member of the SpokenWeb research network. I'd like to begin

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.170
 O'Driscoll:
  by acknowledging the indigenous peoples of all the lands that we are on today.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.839
 O'Driscoll:
  Given that we meet here on a virtual platform I would like to take a moment to acknowledge

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.910
 O'Driscoll:
  the importance of the land that we each call home. We do this to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.140
 O'Driscoll:
  reaffirm our commitment and responsibility in improving relationships between

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.509
 O'Driscoll:
  nations and to improving our own understanding of local indigenous peoples

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:44.539
 O'Driscoll:
  and their cultures. From coast to coast to coast we

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.856
 O'Driscoll:
  acknowledge the ancestral and unceded territory of all Inuit,

00:00:48.856 --> 00:00:52.950
 O'Driscoll:
  Métis, and First Nations that call this home. The

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.159
 O'Driscoll:
  University of Alberta is located on Treaty 6 territory

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.170
 O'Driscoll:
  and the Métis Nation Homeland. I invite each of you to consider

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.218
 O'Driscoll:
  the traditional lands on which you might be located and take a moment to

00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:09.425
 O'Driscoll:
  consider the responsibilities that follow from that. The

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:13.659
 O'Driscoll:
  SSHRC-funded SpokenWeb partnership brings together literary scholars

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.689
 O'Driscoll:
  and digital humanists, librarians and archivists, media historians,

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.769
 O'Driscoll:
  sound artists, oral historians, designers, programmers, poets,

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:25.980
 O'Driscoll:
  musicians, cultural activists, and performers to learn about,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.299
 O'Driscoll:
  share, and study literary sound recordings. We

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.390
 O'Driscoll:
  are committed to the development, preservation, accessibility, and study

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.459
 O'Driscoll:
  of literary audio. And to that end our researchers and students are building

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.030
 O'Driscoll:
  a national network of literary audio, recovering and digitizing

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.334
 O'Driscoll:
  thousands of literary performances from the magnetic tape era, that

00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:52.030
 O'Driscoll:
  is reel-to-reel and cassette tape recordings that together comprise a vast

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.030
 O'Driscoll:
  and important cultural heritage. But we're also

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.299
 O'Driscoll:
  very much engaged in the current moment of creation and to that end we support

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.439
 O'Driscoll:
  and celebrate literary performances such as this, recording and

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.520
 O'Driscoll:
  preserving them for posterity. SpokenWeb's Archive of the

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:03.060
 O'Driscoll:
  can personally attest are absolutely brilliantly crafted with

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.870
 O'Driscoll:
  sparkling prose and deftly drawn characters caught up in often surprising

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.919
 O'Driscoll:
  and revealing and moving circumstances. But

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:16.199
 O'Driscoll:
  Uche is also an incredibly generous creative artist who works

 Umezurike:
  Sonuga, two amazing Nigerian Canadian writers, to talk about your work and vision.

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.740

  I'm super excited to introduce our guests writers Ifeoma

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.830

 Umezurike:
 please join me in virtually welcoming both of them.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:13.319
 Umezurike:
 Let me briefly read their bios. I'll begin with Ifeoma

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.449
 Umezurike:
 Chinwuba, who is currently the writer-in-residence in the Department of English

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.769

 Umezurike:
 sixty countries in the world. She's also a celebrated novelist,

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.560

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.959
 Umezurike:

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.930
 Umezurike:
  Ifeoma is also the author of African Romance,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.170
 Umezurike:
  an epic poem in dialogue, which is by turns funny

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.879
 Umezurike:
  and scathing. And she's also published

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.970
 Umezurike:
 a true verse novella titled Head Boy, and thank you very

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.009
much Ifeoma for gifting me a copy of that. So,

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.410
 Umezurike:
 Titilope Sonuga, she's currently

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.069
 Umezurike:
 the City of Edmonton Poet Laureate. She's also a celebrated poet,

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:36.720
 Umezurike:
 playwright, and performer. And I'm if I'm not mistaken she has also dabbled

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.730
 Umezurike:
  in acting and Nollywood, which

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.160
 Umezurike:
 is the equivalent of Hollywood or Bollywood for those

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.949
 Umezurike:
 who are not familiar the Nigerian film industry. Titilope has performed her poetry in Africa,

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.980
 Umezurike:
 Europe, North America, and she is the author of

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.240
 Umezurike:
  three poetry collections, namely Down to Earth,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.319
 Umezurike:

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.629
 Umezurike:
 has also composed and released two spoken word albums titled

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:11.699
 Umezurike:
  Mother Tongue and Swim. And Both

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.930
 Umezurike:
  spoken word albums are online on YouTube,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.879
 Umezurike:
 you can maybe after the program just check them out. They are beautiful,

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.759
 Umezurike:
  visually appealing, and they of course wonderful

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:31.649
 Umezurike:
  renditions of the poems by Titilope.

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:36.370
 Umezurike:
  I should add that Titilope has published three plays, namely The Six,

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.449
 Umezurike:
 Naked, and a musical titled Ada The Country.

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.910
 Umezurike:
 Her writing has been trusted into Italian, German,

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.189
 Umezurike:
  and Slovak. So, again thank you for coming

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:54.250
 Umezurike:
 to today's events, Ifeoma and Titilope.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.579
 Umezurike:
  We'll now invite Titilope for a reading, just

00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:03.529
 Umezurike:
  for five minutes. And after Titilope finishes reading, Ifeoma will

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:07.829
 Umezurike:
  go next. And after that, we'll have some conversations around

00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:12.769
 Umezurike:
 their work, their social vision, and what they currently do

00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:16.860
 Umezurike:
 in Edmonton. So, thank you again, Ifeoma and Titilope.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.420
 Umezurike:
  So, Titilope I invite you to please read your work.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.610
 Sonuga:
  Thank you, and I just wanted to say that it's an honor to share

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.879
 Sonuga:
 the stage with, with you. It's a rare treat to have three Nigerian writers

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:33.939
 Sonuga:
  in the same space, in another country, in another continent, and

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:37.980
 Sonuga:
 thank you to the U of A and SpokenWeb for making this possible. So, we're doing things

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.000
 Sonuga:
 a bit differently by each starting with poems that are urgent and

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.050
 Sonuga:
 relevant to us in this time. So, this isn't my work but as a

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.199
 Sonuga:
 woman and a mother who is raising small children in a pandemic this poem

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:55.560
 Sonuga:
 by Maggie Smith called Interrogators of Orchids is one that feels

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.329
 Sonuga:
  very timely for me in this time. And so here it goes.

00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:04.430
 Sonuga:
  What do we do we? We birth new citizens and

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.519
 Sonuga:
  answer their bodies with our bodies we rock the

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:12.639
 Sonuga:
  new citizens to sleep. We clothe them with skin and

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:16.819
 Sonuga:
  stamp their passports with milk. We teach the new

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:21.800
 Sonuga:
 citizens to walk and speak. We show them orchids and ask,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.029
 Sonuga:
  what do they look like? What would you ask an orchid if we could ask

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:30.410
 Sonuga:
  it anything? We show them wind and light in the trees

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.600
 Sonuga:
 and ask, what does it sound like? We hold their hands

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.600
 Sonuga:
 in our hands and rub their palms together in small circles and ask, do

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.639
 Sonuga:
  you hear the leaves touching each other? We teach the new

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:46.639
 Sonuga:
 citizens to question landscape. We teach them to love by

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:51.110
 Sonuga:
  questioning, and they ask where was I before

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.190
 Sonuga:
 this place, before your body, before

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:59.860
 Sonuga:
  before. We birth the new citizens, interrogators

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.049
 Sonuga:
 of orchids, interrogators of air, and bring them as far as

00:09:04.049 --> 00:09:08.740
 Sonuga:
  we can. We bring them into a kind of border signed

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.919
 Sonuga:
  and stamped the world is a letter we leave them to steam

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:17.090
 Sonuga:
 open. We let them see dappled shadow under the trees and

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.190
 Sonuga:
 ask, how does the lights not lose its patience between the

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.450
 Sonuga:
  sky and the ground? Thank you.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.799
 Umezurike:
  Thank you very much Titilope for that amazing

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:34.320
 Umezurike:
 performance of Maggie Smith's poem.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.340
 Umezurike:
 Ifeoma, I would like to invite you to read your

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.360
 Umezurike:
 own poem.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.450
 Chinwuba:
  Thank you very much, Uche.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.769
 Chinwuba:
  Thank you Titi Sonuga for this collaboration together.

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:55.340
 Chinwuba:
 As I usually do I like to thank the University of

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.039
 Chinwuba:
  Alberta Department of English and Film Studies for the opportunity.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:05.129
 Chinwuba:
  Having me as your writer-in-residence, enabling

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:09.440
 Chinwuba:
  me to meet the Edmonton...

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.320
 Chinwuba:
  Let's me focus on on writing.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.610
 Chinwuba:
  Forget the distractions of daily living. So, I'm very grateful for the Department

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:25.950
 Chinwuba:
  of English and Film Studies of the University of Alberta.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.080
 Chinwuba:
  The poem that I'm going to read now is The Solitary Reaper

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.309
 Chinwuba:
  by William Wordsworth.

00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:38.850
 Chinwuba:
  Uche, you said we would start this event by

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.750
 Chinwuba:
  recalling poems, poets that have

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.889
 Chinwuba:
  influenced us, that resonate with us,

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:52.269
 Chinwuba:
  and so my choice

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:57.649
 Chinwuba:
  really is without hesitation is Solitary Reaper

00:10:57.649 --> 00:11:02.120
 Chinwuba:
  by William Wordsworth. I'm going to stand up. The Solitary Reaper by William Wordsworth.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:08.919
 Chinwuba:
  Behold her, single in the field, Yon solitary Highland Lass!

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:14.299
 Chinwuba:
  Reaping and singing by herself; Stop there, or

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:18.519
 Chinwuba:
  gently pass! Alone she cuts and

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:23.279
 Chinwuba:
  binds the grain, and sings a meloncholy strain;

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:27.580
 Chinwuba:
  O listen! For the Vale profound is

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.330
 Chinwuba:
  overflowing with the sound. No Nightengale did ever

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.570
 Chinwuba:
  chant. More welcome notes to weary bands

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:46.860
 Chinwuba:
  of travellers in some shady haunt, Among Arabian sands,

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.490
 Chinwuba:
  A voice so thrilling never was heard in spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird, Breaking

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.500
 Chinwuba:
  the silence of the seas, [snaps] Among the farthest Hebrides.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.519
 Chinwuba:
  Will no one tell me

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:04.740
 Chinwuba:
  what she sings? Perhaps the plaintive

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.919
 Chinwuba:
  numbers flow for old, unhappy, far-off

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:14.909
 Chinwuba:
  things, and battles of long ago:

00:12:14.909 --> 00:12:20.330
 Chinwuba:
  Or is it some more humble lay,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.879
 Chinwuba:
  familiar matter of to-day?

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:31.090
 Chinwuba:
  Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain, That has been, and may be again?

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:35.509
 Chinwuba:
  Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang

00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:39.600
 Chinwuba:
  As if her song could have no ending; I saw her

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:45.220
 Chinwuba:
  singing at her work, And o'er the sickle bending;

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.309
 Chinwuba:
  I listened motionless and still;

00:12:50.309 --> 00:12:54.629
 Chinwuba:
  And, as I mounted up the hill, The music in my heart

00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:59.809
 Chinwuba:
  I bore, Long after it was heard no more.

00:12:59.809 --> 00:13:05.309
 Chinwuba:
  Thank you.

00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:10.399
 Umezurike:
  Oh, wow. [clapping] That's affecting, Ifeoma. I'm really thrilled by how you you conjure so much

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:14.580
 Umezurike:
  mood, such passion for

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:21.210
 Umezurike:
  recollecting that Wordsworthian uh

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:25.340
 Umezurike:
  beauty, and I I feel when I started writing poetry William

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:29.539
 Umezurike:
  Wordsworth was one of the poets I looked to.

00:13:29.539 --> 00:13:33.570
 Umezurike:
 And I remember

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.590
 Umezurike:
 Ode on an... Ode on... Tintern Abbey, I think, and

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.629
 Umezurike:
 Intonations of Immortality, those were two poems

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:45.730
 Umezurike:
 I always turn to uh while

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:50.220
 Umezurike:
 trying to imitate these great poets. And uh

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.259
 Titilope, thank you, also. And I I know one of your two of your

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:58.460
 Umezurike:
 literary influences are Sonia Sanchez

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.710
 Umezurike:
 and Maya Angelou. And uh I would

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:07.629
 Umezurike:
 want you to talk more about uh Maggie Smith, if possible,

00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:11.769
 Umezurike:
 and then other poets or writers

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:15.769
 Umezurike:
 that have influenced, that have shaped your your

00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:20.299
 Umezurike:
 poetic vision or even your social vision as well as a writer.

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:25.009
 Umezurike:
  And Ifeoma I also want you to talk more about your literary influences

00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:29.620
 Umezurike:
 because I know that there's so much idyllic and pastoral quality

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.220
 Umezurike:
 to the the kind of poems I've heard you I've heard you read

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.299
 Umezurike:
 and uh this

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:42.669
 Umezurike:
 ideal that uh resonates in the kind of poetry

00:14:42.669 --> 00:14:47.629
 Umezurike:
 you write in terms of landscape, uh birds,

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:51.740
 Umezurike:
 plateaus, hills, and the the the river. So, I

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.440
 Umezurike:
 would really appreciate uh if uh both of you can share

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.950
 Umezurike:
 what draws you to these

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.000
 Umezurike:
 these poets, these writers, and what you find fascinating or

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.090
 Umezurike:
 even illuminating about their their work.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:13.750
 Sonuga:
  I'm deeply fascinated by people who are able to take

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.879
 Sonuga:
 sort of the quiet intimacies of everyday life and turn

00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:21.899
 Sonuga:
 that into something that feels big and beautiful. Those

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:25.960
 Sonuga:
 kind of writers as reminds me that like

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.289
 Sonuga:
 just what is happening in your life in this moment can

00:15:30.289 --> 00:15:34.570
 Sonuga:
 be a large statements. That poems don't always

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.720
 Sonuga:
 have to be epics to be epic, you understand what I mean. And I think that

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.360
 Sonuga:
 it's particularly significant for me now in a time where so much of our writing

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.639
 Sonuga:
 is more insular than it used to be. We're not

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:51.879
 Sonuga:
 out in the world in the ways that we used to be so a lot of us writers are called to kind

00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:56.450
 Sonuga:
 of to think about what within these four walls that we're confined to

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.659
 Sonuga:
 is still worthy of being elevated

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:04.809
 Sonuga:
 and honored and celebrated. And that's particularly why

00:16:04.809 --> 00:16:09.250
 Sonuga:
 Maggie Smith's work speaks to me. She so beautifully

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.629
 Sonuga:
 writes small moments very very well. She writes small moments

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:18.080
 Sonuga:
 to be a thing of beauty, and it's a skill that I

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.100
 Sonuga:
 I am etching away at. But

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.110
 Sonuga:
 I love all all artists. And I would say that my

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:30.549
 Sonuga:
 my work isn't only influenced by poets. But um I understand

00:16:30.549 --> 00:16:34.690
 Sonuga:
 that I come in the tradition of Mabel Segun and even

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.820
 Sonuga:
 Buche Emecheta and writers who who in

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:44.789
 Sonuga:
 their time were creating work that that was

00:16:44.789 --> 00:16:49.509
 Sonuga:
 beautiful in its simplicity and was a massive political statement

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:53.909
 Sonuga:
 of the time. To be telling these stories in that time in those ways

00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:58.090
 Sonuga:
 um by by women writers who aren't necessarily celebrated as part

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:02.179
 Sonuga:
 of the canon. Um, Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, Sonia Sanchez, as you

00:17:02.179 --> 00:17:06.519
 Sonuga:
 mentioned. Again for this idea. Toni Morrison was a writer who always

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:11.309
 Sonuga:
 emphasized the idea that she was writing for a specific audience.

00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:15.329
 Sonuga:
 And the gaze that she was writing towards was theirs. And so they were a

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:19.339
 Sonuga:
 lot of things in her work that were left unsaid. That is something I find really beautiful,

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:23.410
 Sonuga:
 as well. And I mean I love music just as much as I love poetry. I listen to the poetry

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.490
 Sonuga:
 in music. I love Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu. And so, when I'm sitting

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:31.690
 Sonuga:
 down to write, I'm not just drawing from influences of poets and writers, I'm drawing

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.759
 Sonuga:
 from the world that I live in. And and the the poetry that I hear in

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:40.279
 Sonuga:
 those things that aren't necessarily poetry on the surface. So that's

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:45.160
 Sonuga:
 that's the work that moves me.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.369
 Umezurike:
  Thank you very much for sharing. I also, I'm a fan of Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill. And I I hope you also enjoy Asa.

00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:53.630
 Sonuga:
  I love Asa. Oh! I love Asa.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:58.000
 Umezurike:
  Oh great! Uh, Ifeoma, over to you.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.930
 Chinwuba:
  Right, thank you.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:07.450
 Chinwuba:
 The Solitary Reaper, William Wordsworth, is the very first

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:12.519
 Chinwuba:
  poem I came across in my life. The very first. Um.

00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:16.930
 Chinwuba:
  As I said as I've said before, I was a young refugee

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.119
 Chinwuba:
 in in Ireland. We had just had just fled

00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:25.650
 Chinwuba:
 from Nigeria, Biafra then, to

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:30.299
 Chinwuba:
 Libreville, Gavon. And from Libreville, after three months, I'd been in Poland. A family, a foster family

00:18:30.299 --> 00:18:34.589
 Chinwuba:
 took me and my, some of my siblings into their

00:18:34.589 --> 00:18:38.700
 Chinwuba:
 home in Ireland, in County Donegal. And so we

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.329
 Chinwuba:
 went to school. Back in Biafra then. Back in Nigeria. We are

00:18:43.329 --> 00:18:47.569
 Chinwuba:
 still, you know, English is not our first language. Igbo is. We are all

00:18:47.569 --> 00:18:51.569
 Chinwuba:
 communicating in Igbo. And trying to learn English.

00:18:51.569 --> 00:18:56.589
 Chinwuba:
 You know is, was, make a sentence. This is a goat. This is a car. And then

00:18:56.589 --> 00:19:00.900
 Chinwuba:
 I'm transported into Ireland. And I think they put me

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.650
 Chinwuba:
 in primary four, or so, in five. And then, the teacher there

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.710
 Chinwuba:
 is teaching us poems. I'd never come across any poems. So, this was one of the

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:16.329
 Chinwuba:
 poems I came across in my life. And the thing

00:19:16.329 --> 00:19:20.500
 Chinwuba:
 struck me. There's a woman in the field working

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.740
 Chinwuba:
 and singing. And it reminded me of my own mother

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.940
 Chinwuba:
 back in Africa. Every time she was working, doing chores,

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.150
 Chinwuba:
 she was always humming her folklore, music from her village. Because she

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.269
 Chinwuba:
 she didn't come from simply just my father. She was always working and singing.

00:19:37.269 --> 00:19:41.390
 Chinwuba:
 She reminded me of my mother. And it

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:45.509
 Chinwuba:
 unleashed anguish. Because there were no photos, no telephones,

00:19:45.509 --> 00:19:49.630
 Chinwuba:
 nothing. Like we just imagined her, you know. And

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.819
 Chinwuba:
 then the poem speaks of battles of long ago, you know. Matters of

00:19:53.819 --> 00:19:58.210
 Chinwuba:
 sorrow, of pain, so it resonated with me, and

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.849
 Chinwuba:
 it stuck. Held me hostage.

00:20:02.849 --> 00:20:08.180
 Chinwuba:
 And um in order to recapture that ambience of my mother, you know. We learned this poem as a

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:13.509
 Chinwuba:
 poem, but I used to sing it as a folklore.

00:20:13.509 --> 00:20:17.619
 Chinwuba:
 I converted it into folklore. Because in the family where

00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:22.400
 Chinwuba:
 I was was my. I was there with my younger sister, Agnes. Two of us with one family. My

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.410
 Chinwuba:
 brother was elsewhere. My elder sister was elsewhere. So, I

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:31.519
 Chinwuba:
 converted this poem to a folklore. I used to sing

00:20:31.519 --> 00:20:36.279
 Chinwuba:
 Behold her, single in the field, Yon solitary Highland Lass! Ah! Reaping and singing by herself,

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:40.970
 Chinwuba:
 Stop there, or gently pass! Stop there, or

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.990
 Chinwuba:
  gently pass! Trying to convert it into a folklore. Like

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.279
 Chinwuba:
 my mother used to do. So, this is the fact. This is what

00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:53.289
 Chinwuba:
 this poem means to me. Um because

00:20:53.289 --> 00:20:57.549
 Chinwuba:
  my writings later I I invoke

00:20:57.549 --> 00:21:02.910
 Chinwuba:
 this bucolic, this pastoral atmosphere. And um

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.960
 Chinwuba:
 I also eulogize.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.910
 Chinwuba:
 Eulogize a woman. Eulogize a woman working, singing, lively.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:16.109
 Chinwuba:
 Giving pleasure music to passers by.

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:20.319
 Chinwuba:
 So, it uh introduced

00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:24.420
 Chinwuba:
 me to to the panegyric, you know? Singing the praise of

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:28.460
 Chinwuba:
 women in my writings. They are there. But the

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:33.490
 Chinwuba:
 writing has evolved, you know. As we will see later when we read the other

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.690
 Chinwuba:
 other things we have done. This is the only um aspect of this event where

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.140
 Chinwuba:
 we invoke other people's writing. Subsequently, we are going to go back

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.230
 Chinwuba:
 to our work.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:50.359
 Chinwuba:
 So, that is the that is the place this poem of William Wordsworth

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:55.220
 Chinwuba:
 has in my literary cosmos. Thank you.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.569
 Umezurike:
  Thank you very much, Ifeoma for sharing that bit about

00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:03.789
 Umezurike:
  your development as a poet and a writer. Oh,

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:08.039
 Umezurike:
  just a quick one. I was wondering are there other writers

00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:12.250
 Umezurike:
  aside from Wordsworth that

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:17.990
 Umezurike:
  shaped you as a poet and writer?

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:22.130
 Umezurike:
  Because I want to assume, I want to take the liberty to assume, that maybe

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.369
 Umezurike:
  someone like Chinua Achebe or Zulu Sofola or

00:22:26.369 --> 00:22:31.299
 Umezurike:
  like Titilope mentioned Buchi Emecheta or maybe Esehagu.

00:22:31.299 --> 00:22:35.819
 Umezurike:
  If possibly...

00:22:35.819 --> 00:22:39.839
 Chinwuba:
  Oh yeah, there are so many. Where do you start from? Because one thing a writer must do is to read, widely.

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:43.890
 Chinwuba:
  Every writer must read. And so we have read so widely and,

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:48.720
 Chinwuba:
  you know, meet them along the way. Um John Donne, you know.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.329
 Chinwuba:
  I also like John Donne, in a way, you know.

00:22:53.329 --> 00:22:57.660
 Chinwuba:
  Some of his poems. Death Be Not Proud. That kind of thing, you know?

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.289
 Chinwuba:
  Will Shakespeare's sonnets. So many sonnets. Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Such like.

00:23:02.289 --> 00:23:06.509
 Chinwuba:
  Which, as I said, I studied the classics in university.

00:23:06.509 --> 00:23:10.619
 Chinwuba:
  English and French. And so, that gives you the whole literature of

00:23:10.619 --> 00:23:15.609
 Chinwuba:
  the English language and all the the French language. So, they all had

00:23:15.609 --> 00:23:19.609
 Chinwuba:
  impacted me, you know...

00:23:19.609 --> 00:23:23.900
 Chinwuba:
  French, English, Honoré de Balzac. All of them impacted me.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.609
 Chinwuba:
  And, um, also Nigerian poets. Like J. P. Clark.

00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:32.869
 Chinwuba:
  You know? Who also talked about normal, day

00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:36.940
 Chinwuba:
  African experiences.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.680
 Chinwuba:
  Like the spirit child we met last week.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.890
 Chinwuba:
  The child that dies and comes again. Never to spoke about a night rain. You know, simple things that uh.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:50.059
 Chinwuba:
  And in very simple language, you know? I was

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:54.059
 Chinwuba:
  discussing with my sister the other day. She lives in Paris, which was... We were

00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:58.700
 Chinwuba:
  discussing one one article. I said, you see how simple the language is?

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:04.220
 Chinwuba:
  You don't have to invent, you know... sounding verse.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.880
 Chinwuba:
  So, the poetry of J. P. Clark. Very interesting.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.079
 Chinwuba:
  ...You know? He's a

00:24:13.079 --> 00:24:17.630
 Chinwuba:
  Nigerian writer. There's also, you know. And then the writings

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.789
 Chinwuba:
  of um. There's a lady, Senegalese woman, who wrote

00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:26.289
 Chinwuba:
   Une Si Longue Lettre, So Long a Letter.

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:30.480
 Chinwuba:
  You know, that's about... African romance.

00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:30.480
 Umezurike:
  Mariama Bâ

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.940
 Chinwuba:
  So many influences, you know, on me. Because

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.000
 Chinwuba:
  as a writer you're encouraged to read wide. And so all of these things

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.150
 Chinwuba:
  you know, consciously, you pick here, you pick there, you pick here, you pick there, and

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:47.349
 Chinwuba:
  then you have a melange, so many.

00:24:47.349 --> 00:24:51.410
 Umezurike:
  Yeah, thank you very much for the fan-fantastic response, Ifeoma.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.660
 Umezurike:
  If I could, I'll come back to this question

00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.420
 Umezurike:
  of polygamy, which is something you you touched on in

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.720
 Umezurike:
  African Romance and a a your own

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.670
 Umezurike:
  take on... and Mariama Ba who wrote

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:14.059
 Umezurike:
  So Long a Letter, yeah. And so uh

00:25:14.059 --> 00:25:18.269
 Umezurike:
  be-before we go to the next conversation, I want you to read

00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:22.579
 Umezurike:
  a an excerpt from your work. And then after you are finished

00:25:22.579 --> 00:25:26.650
 Umezurike:
  reading it, Titilope will go next. And after that I'll ask

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:30.769
 Umezurike:
  another set of questions. And then before

00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:34.940
 Umezurike:
  we go for the final reading, I'll allow the audience to ask

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.490
 Umezurike:
  you both questions. Because I know they are. They are brimming with questions

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:44.769
 Umezurike:
  for both of you. So, Ifeoma I invite you to

00:25:44.769 --> 00:25:49.000
 Umezurike:
  read just a short excerpt from your work. And then after that Titilope.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.279
 Chinwuba:
  Right, thank you, Uche. I'm going to read from

00:25:53.279 --> 00:26:00.910
 Chinwuba:
  this book African Romance. African Romance. It's a...

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:05.630
 Chinwuba:
  It's situated in a polygamous home where the the

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.809
 Chinwuba:
  woman is complaining because her husband doesn't

00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:14.910
 Chinwuba:
  have time for her. And there there's a back and forth.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:19.039
 Chinwuba:
  She abuses the husband. The husband abuses her back. They both chime in and

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:23.319
 Chinwuba:
  say, oh, you know. When two people are fighting in, you know,

00:26:23.319 --> 00:26:28.119
 Chinwuba:
  African society people gather. And then some are hating this one. Some are

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:32.910
 Chinwuba:
  calling... That kind of thing. So, but

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:37.230
 Chinwuba:
  after awhile the woman realizes that. Hey, who are the people causing this

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:41.569
 Chinwuba:
  trouble in my my household? It's the women outside.

00:26:41.569 --> 00:26:46.220
 Chinwuba:
  You know, the mistresses the... And so she addresses them at some point.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:50.309
 Chinwuba:
  So, that is the point I'm going to read now. Because awhile

00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:54.900
 Chinwuba:
  ago I spoke about the... like

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.900
 Chinwuba:
  you know like eulogies. But the woman is is human.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.220
 Chinwuba:
  She's not an angel. She has her warts and all.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.710
 Chinwuba:
  And so this is why I chose this passage. To show that,

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:16.650
 Chinwuba:
  okay, we praise women and all. But women are also the cause of our problems. They could be accused of misogyny!

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:21.079
 Chinwuba:
  Because they are the cause of the woman a woman's problem. So, let me read the passage and then later

00:27:21.079 --> 00:27:25.559
 Chinwuba:
  we can talk more about it. [clears throat]

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:29.750
 Chinwuba:
  So, you Ronke and Bisi, Ifunanya. And Chichi, Amina and co.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:34.599
 Chinwuba:
  You shady throng. Anonymous arsonists.

00:27:34.599 --> 00:27:39.230
 Chinwuba:
  Miss Nobodies. You have broken into my home. And made

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:43.250
 Chinwuba:
  away with my walking stick. You stay outside in your

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:47.869
 Chinwuba:
  part of town and wreck havoc on the inside of my foyer.

00:27:47.869 --> 00:27:52.809
 Chinwuba:
  Remote control in hand you have quenched the light in my dwelling.

00:27:52.809 --> 00:27:57.140
 Chinwuba:
  You control my husband, his going, his coming,

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.920
 Chinwuba:
  his travells out of town. In town. You

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.130
 Chinwuba:
  flash like lightening, and he hurries into the smallest room to dial your number

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:11.309
 Chinwuba:
  and speak in low tones amid flushing waters. You 419er

00:28:11.309 --> 00:28:15.329
 Chinwuba:
  reaping where you did not sow. You weave Ponzi into

00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:19.609
 Chinwuba:
  your head, braids winding like a footpath

00:28:19.609 --> 00:28:23.950
 Chinwuba:
  into the abyss. You dress in flimsy rags

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:28.339
 Chinwuba:
  in the name of fashion. Your neck long like the ostrich,

00:28:28.339 --> 00:28:32.519
 Chinwuba:
  bare like a vulture's, is naked to the eye down to

00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:36.740
 Chinwuba:
  your navel. Your tight corsets outline your

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.920
 Chinwuba:
  excesses, matching left and right, up and down, from

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.720
 Chinwuba:
  one joint to the other, from one spot to the other. Zombies

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.740
 Chinwuba:
  in search of monied men. You have swooped

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:54.210
 Chinwuba:
  on my home like a pitiless hawk.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.299
 Chinwuba:
  Broken into my pantry and stolen my meat. Now,

00:28:58.299 --> 00:29:02.430
 Chinwuba:
  my soup pot is bare like your shoulders. My meager

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:07.359
 Chinwuba:
  meals lie like me cold and untouched.

00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:12.440
 Chinwuba:
  Of what use is a wife when her Maigida is homeless?

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.509
 Chinwuba:
  What is a wife to do when her soup goes stale before

00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:20.569
 Chinwuba:
  her waiting eyes? You have pocketed my man

00:29:20.569 --> 00:29:24.839
 Chinwuba:
  like change. Made me a temp widow.

00:29:24.839 --> 00:29:29.369
 Chinwuba:
  Made away with my provider. Our carpet is scattered.

00:29:29.369 --> 00:29:33.930
 Chinwuba:
  Our roof leaks a-plenty. The curtains have faded.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:38.140
 Chinwuba:
  The chair torn in places. I live in squalor

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:43.089
 Chinwuba:
  because of you. You have turned my husband's head away from home.

00:29:43.089 --> 00:29:48.400
 Chinwuba:
  When I talk to him he snaps at me. But when you flash like thunder

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.640
 Chinwuba:
  he dashes away and talks in whispers. [laughs]

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:58.240
 Chinwuba:
  His voice becomes flirty. You! You! A woman like

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.009
 Chinwuba:
  me, you are my tormentor. Thank you!

00:30:03.009 --> 00:30:07.430
 Umezurike:
  Wow! Thank you very much for that dramatic

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:11.779
 Umezurike:
  performance of the... monologue. And uh

00:30:11.779 --> 00:30:15.819
 Umezurike:
  there's a spot that we'll come to the to the question

00:30:15.819 --> 00:30:21.180
 Umezurike:
  where you talked about women are their worst enemies. And for me I

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.200
 Umezurike:
  I found that a bit provocative. But we'll talk about that soon enough.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.920
 Umezurike:
  So, Titilope, could you go next?

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.089
 Sonuga:
  Yes, um, this poem is called Missing, and it's

00:30:34.089 --> 00:30:38.500
 Sonuga:
  from my collection This is How We Disappear. And it tries to draw

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.559
 Sonuga:
  parallels between the missing the kidnapped

00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:46.829
 Sonuga:
  Chibok girls, the missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada

00:30:46.829 --> 00:30:51.029
 Sonuga:
  and across the world. And just migration patterns of women

00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:55.539
 Sonuga:
  across the globe. How we disappear in physical and

00:30:55.539 --> 00:31:01.450
 Sonuga:
 psychological ways. Um so I'll just get into the poem. Missing.

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:06.019
 Sonuga:
 As much as I wish to, the president said, I cannot promise that we can find them.

00:31:06.019 --> 00:31:10.579
 Sonuga:
 They converted to Islam, married off to the fighters, Abubakar Shekau said.

00:31:10.579 --> 00:31:15.039
 Sonuga:
 They were taken across the border into Cameroon, witnesses said.

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:19.289
 Sonuga:
  A negotiator told us, at least three died in the early days, from snake bites,

00:31:19.289 --> 00:31:23.900
 Sonuga:
  malaria, dysentery. I'm outraged and heartbroken,

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:28.000
 Sonuga:
 Michelle Obama posted a picture of herself holding a sign. Please

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.220
 Sonuga:
 know this, Malala Yousafzai wrote, we will never forget you.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.490
 Sonuga:
 Years passed without a whisper from the girls. My father's

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:40.569
 Sonuga:
 gun in the upstairs closet will shoot its first and only shot when I am

00:31:40.569 --> 00:31:44.859
 Sonuga:
 ten and the armed robbers come rattling our gate like rabid

00:31:44.859 --> 00:31:49.390
 Sonuga:
 dogs. My three sisters and I huddled in our night gowns on his bedroom floor.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:53.720
 Sonuga:
 We have to leave this country, he whispers to my mother, his finger trembling

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.759
 Sonuga:
 on the trigger. That night my father will almost kill a man

00:31:57.759 --> 00:32:01.809
 Sonuga:
 to protect our childhood. He will never see the words I love you but in

00:32:01.809 --> 00:32:06.200
 Sonuga:
 the chamber of his heart is one loaded bullet.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:10.680
 Sonuga:
 Midnight at the water's edge. Blessing and three thousand refugees

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:14.940
 Sonuga:
 wade in, silent and barefoot. They fall into the sea.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:19.480
 Sonuga:
 Soon, most will wash back ashore with no names to call but the numbers

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.119
 Sonuga:
 scribbled on their clothes. For weeks, the smuggler's telephones on the other side,

00:32:24.119 --> 00:32:28.559
 Sonuga:
 silent. No one to answer for the girls, with skin like rich palm oil

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:33.740
 Sonuga:
  bloodying the water. They build fences in Morocco,

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:38.380
 Sonuga:
 paid the nation's on the coastline to keep the teeming bodies back. Tomorrow,

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.529
 Sonuga:
 Europe may no longer be European, said Qaddafi. We will use human beings

00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:46.539
 Sonuga:
 as weapons, cram the black bodies into fishing trawlers, launch

00:32:46.539 --> 00:32:50.680
 Sonuga:
 them from Libya into the sea. The ungovernable, the slaves,

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.890
 Sonuga:
  the concubines and prostitutes, burn it to the ground.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.910
 Sonuga:
  Swift flowing river snakes its way through the heart of Edmonton to

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:04.710
 Sonuga:
 lay still in the winter of our arrival. Our hands turn white,

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:09.009
 Sonuga:
 the air like shards of glass to our faces. That night our family shares

00:33:09.009 --> 00:33:13.079
 Sonuga:
 a pizza in our basement apartment. We fall asleep, three on

00:33:13.079 --> 00:33:17.269
 Sonuga:
 the bed, three on the floor, our bellies bloated with hope.

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:21.559
 Sonuga:
 We tread water for twenty winters between our yesterdays and the tomorrow

00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:25.640
 Sonuga:
  we were promised. Everything here is borrowed

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.720
 Sonuga:
 or stolen: the language, the land. My

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.900
 Sonuga:
 own body, far flung. I lose my old English, my tongue

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.349
 Sonuga:
 twice colonized. All the women I know are running

00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:43.390
 Sonuga:
 toward, or away, and everything I know of disappearance begins

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:47.720
 Sonuga:
 with water. The women, the girls, their thirsty mouths open skyward,

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.809
 Sonuga:
 rainwater muddying the forest floor. The six

00:33:51.809 --> 00:33:56.180
 Sonuga:
 month ocean crossing that pulls the salt from our skin. The dam

00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:00.210
 Sonuga:
 breaking inside my mother. The first blood sacrifice that pulled me from

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:04.599
 Sonuga:
 one world into the next began inside a woman, sliced

00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:08.768
 Sonuga:
 down the middle, so another woman could emerge whole. All

00:34:08.768 --> 00:34:13.639
 Sonuga:
  I know of magic making and survival I learnt at birth.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.670
 Sonuga:
  And I want to defend my country. Which one?

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:22.000
 Sonuga:
  I mythologize my grandmother, I write stories about warrior women with thunder

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.070
 Sonuga:
 between their thighs. Then the girls disappear, and no one goes looking. I

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:30.219
 Sonuga:
 ask my mother the Yoruba word for shame. Do you know

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:34.260
 Sonuga:
  they only drank water when it rained? What kind of country does nothing when

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.610
 Sonuga:
  two hundred girls disappear? A thousand indigenous women stop

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:43.050
 Sonuga:
  in their tracks, crane their necks back in unison. Tears flood the highway

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:47.469
 Sonuga:
  till even the rivers overflow. The girls had disappeared

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:51.579
 Sonuga:
 for three weeks before we knew their names. Then we spoke them. Two

00:34:51.579 --> 00:34:55.699
 Sonuga:
 hundred and seventy-six in Chibok, but thousands more, missing and

00:34:55.699 --> 00:35:00.730
 Sonuga:
  murdered across the country, answered. It is customary

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:05.099
 Sonuga:
  to wait seven days to name a child. Touch her lips with water

00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:09.250
 Sonuga:
  and palm oil, honey and salt, kola, give her

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:13.469
 Sonuga:
  a taste of the bitter and the sweet, the joy and the pain.

00:35:13.469 --> 00:35:17.809
 Sonuga:
  Pray for her a spirit with the resilience of water.

00:35:17.809 --> 00:35:21.949
 Sonuga:
  All of this just say: stay.

00:35:21.949 --> 00:35:27.599
 Sonuga:
  Thank you.

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:33.739
 Umezurike:
  Wow. I I'm just speechless, Titilope. Anytime I just

00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:41.400
 Umezurike:
  listing to your poetry, I'm always left stunned

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.579
 Umezurike:
  by its sheer beauty, by the evocative

00:35:45.579 --> 00:35:50.960
 Umezurike:
  strength of the lines. I remember

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.250
 Umezurike:
  listening to This Woman is

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:59.309
 Umezurike:
  Not Your Mother where you talked about the

00:35:59.309 --> 00:36:03.599
 Umezurike:
  this woman is not a the right of passage.

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:07.699
 Umezurike:
  This woman is not a project. And this woman is not a sin. This brings

00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:12.250
 Umezurike:
  me to my second question about the the connection in your work

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:16.420
 Umezurike:
  and Ifeoma's work particularly Merchants

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:21.579
 Umezurike:
  of Flesh. And I I notice that

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:25.659
 Umezurike:
  both of your works deal with the silencing of

00:36:25.659 --> 00:36:30.480
 Umezurike:
  women in society, of female invisibility, commodification,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.619
 Umezurike:
  and trafficking and objectification of women. And uh

00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:38.960
 Umezurike:
  How that can call attention

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.980
 Umezurike:
  to the tragic plight off the

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.460
 Umezurike:
  the girl tried, women caught up in

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.519
 Umezurike:
  global sex trade, as we see in Merchants of Flesh.

00:36:51.519 --> 00:36:56.289
 Umezurike:
  Or even women caught up in an affair of

00:36:56.289 --> 00:37:00.440
 Umezurike:
  the legal or justice system as Ifeoma depicts in

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.619
 Umezurike:
  Waiting for Maria. And I really like that novel because

00:37:04.619 --> 00:37:08.980
 Umezurike:
  I I like the way Ifeoma used the broken

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.210
 Umezurike:
  down, dysfunctional vehicle

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:17.780
 Umezurike:
  known as black Maria, which is used to transport inmates

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:21.820
 Umezurike:
  or the accused to the prison. And it's so striking that's the the

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:27.019
 Umezurike:
  vehicle is grounded. It's it doesn't work.

00:37:27.019 --> 00:37:32.139
 Umezurike:
  And it makes me think sadly about our country, Nigeria,

00:37:32.139 --> 00:37:36.610
 Umezurike:
  as a stationary, grounded vehicle

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:41.130
 Umezurike:
  that doesn't move. And eventually decides to move

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:45.300
 Umezurike:
  When it was repaired in the novel

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.320
 Umezurike:
  somehow it got filled with smoke and the

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.480
 Umezurike:
  inmates in the vehicle were

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.530
 Umezurike:
  choked to death by the fumes.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:02.260
 Umezurike:
  And uh we we know that the the Chibok tragedy

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.429
 Umezurike:
  in 2014 reflects the sort

00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:10.550
 Umezurike:
  of dysfunction in the body politic of Nigeria. So, my

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:14.550
 Umezurike:
  question would be uh the condition of

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:19.789
 Umezurike:
  women within Nigeria and generally in Africa is still bleak.

00:38:19.789 --> 00:38:23.969
 Umezurike:
  How can we get literature to

00:38:23.969 --> 00:38:28.449
 Umezurike:
  incite more conversations and awareness about

00:38:28.449 --> 00:38:32.489
 Umezurike:
  the commodification of women. So I'll I'd

00:38:32.489 --> 00:38:36.820
 Umezurike:
  like Titilope to respond first, and then after that

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.329
 Umezurike:
  Ifeoma you can take a shot at that question.

00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:46.010
 Umezurike:
  How what can literature do to further stimulate conversations

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.929
 Umezurike:
  around female objectification, sex trafficking,

00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:55.139
 Umezurike:
  human trafficking, and all the structures that

00:38:55.139 --> 00:38:59.309
 Umezurike:
  demean and degrade female personhood.

00:38:59.309 --> 00:39:04.269
 Sonuga:
  I guess I'll start by saying that I think

00:39:04.269 --> 00:39:08.800
 Sonuga:
  the condition of women across the world um

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.809
 Sonuga:
  is worthy of conversation. I don't think

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:17.019
 Sonuga:
  that it is uniquely a Nigerian or African problem. But there are gaps

00:39:17.019 --> 00:39:21.239
 Sonuga:
  as you said. There are a...

00:39:21.239 --> 00:39:25.389
 Sonuga:
  There is progress made in in some ways and and

00:39:25.389 --> 00:39:29.670
 Sonuga:
  not enough in in many ways. And I think we see that the world over.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:34.150
 Sonuga:
  Um, I think that the role of art in general

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:38.269
 Sonuga:
  is to reflect the times. To reflect our humanity. And then leave

00:39:38.269 --> 00:39:42.539
 Sonuga:
  that to the world. To take that in and

00:39:42.539 --> 00:39:46.590
 Sonuga:
  reflect upon its in in whatever ways they will.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:50.849
 Sonuga:
  For me I think it is a radical thing to not

00:39:50.849 --> 00:39:54.849
 Sonuga:
  only write about trage-tragedy and suffering but

00:39:54.849 --> 00:39:58.889
 Sonuga:
  also to writes about joy. I think it is a radical thing to hold those two things

00:39:58.889 --> 00:40:02.989
 Sonuga:
  the side by side, which is why if you if I go back to the poem I

00:40:02.989 --> 00:40:07.650
 Sonuga:
  read first, this this beautiful um, a,

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.809
 Sonuga:
  depiction of motherhood and bringing new citizens into the world. It is why

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:15.949
 Sonuga:
  it even in a collection like This is How We Dissapear, where I'm talking predominantly about

00:40:15.949 --> 00:40:20.139
 Sonuga:
  the disappearance of the Chibok girls, I'm also swinging that that pendulum back

00:40:20.139 --> 00:40:24.590
 Sonuga:
  to the idea of the power and magical nature of womanhood.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:29.039
 Sonuga:
  And the ways we reinvent ourselves to survive,

00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:33.239
 Sonuga:
  to move beyond. I think the ways that we change

00:40:33.239 --> 00:40:37.409
 Sonuga:
  the world is just by telling through true and authentic stories.

00:40:37.409 --> 00:40:42.349
 Sonuga:
  By telling diverse stories. By

00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:46.460
 Sonuga:
  choosing, by making a radical choice

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:50.500
 Sonuga:
  to center joy in our work. To say this is who I am as a fully

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.619
 Sonuga:
  formed human being. These are my dreams and aspirations. These are my hopes and

00:40:54.619 --> 00:40:59.289
 Sonuga:
  concerns. And to believe truly that that has a place

00:40:59.289 --> 00:41:03.429
 Sonuga:
  in in the larger conversation about humanity.

00:41:03.429 --> 00:41:07.489
 Sonuga:
  I guess I I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't believe that it is our duty

00:41:07.489 --> 00:41:12.889
 Sonuga:
  as artists to um

00:41:12.889 --> 00:41:17.409
 Sonuga:
  to be town criers of all the injustices

00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:21.539
 Sonuga:
  you know of the world. It really is our duty to just reflect the times.

00:41:21.539 --> 00:41:25.590
 Sonuga:
  And the times are complicated and muddy and strange and

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:29.639
 Sonuga:
  beautiful and broken. Our job is to is to reflect all of

00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:33.760
 Sonuga:
  that and let that stand in the world. I hope that answers your question.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.840
 Umezurike:
  That's an excellent response, Titilope.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.880
 Umezurike:
  So, over to you Ifeoma.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.880
 Chinwuba:
  Well, I agree with Titi.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:46.909
 Chinwuba:
  That the writer has to capture the zeitgeist

00:41:46.909 --> 00:41:51.440
 Chinwuba:
  of the times. The chronicler, yes, to tell us

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.210
 Chinwuba:
  what is happening in this society. So that years later

00:41:56.210 --> 00:42:00.739
 Chinwuba:
  other generations coming, reading your work, can have an idea how

00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:06.960
 Chinwuba:
  people dressed, how people ate. What happened in the society.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:12.750
 Chinwuba:
  But I don't think it's just to write it and keep it there.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:18.309
 Chinwuba:
  We we are calling for action. Calling for a change.

00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:22.539
 Chinwuba:
  It's more than just writing, capturing it and keeping it for... no.

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:26.590
 Chinwuba:
  Many artists, many writers, many others

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:30.659
 Chinwuba:
  have been locked up. Many journalists, many have been killed because of what they

00:42:30.659 --> 00:42:34.739
 Chinwuba:
  write. Because of what they they... Chinua Achebe was

00:42:34.739 --> 00:42:39.570
 Chinwuba:
  in prison. Wole Soyinka himself. So many have been.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:43.809
 Chinwuba:
  Have lost their lives because of the pen. What they wrote.

00:42:43.809 --> 00:42:48.010
 Chinwuba:
  Because they are speaking to somebody and someone is listening. And so we hope our

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.590
 Chinwuba:
  government will listen. Will read this book, these stories,

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:56.659
 Chinwuba:
  and see what needs to be done. And do it. And change our society.

00:42:56.659 --> 00:43:00.949
 Chinwuba:
  For the better. About the commodification

00:43:00.949 --> 00:43:05.119
 Chinwuba:
  of women, you know, involved in human

00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:09.150
 Chinwuba:
  trafficking back home in Nigeria, Africa, even here, women have been

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:13.880
 Chinwuba:
  dissapearing. Everywhere. Women in America disappear.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:18.000
 Chinwuba:
  But I think it's it's a... The problem with

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.699
 Chinwuba:
  us back home is I think absence of rule of law. Or breakdown

00:43:22.699 --> 00:43:26.719
 Chinwuba:
  of law and good. Because the law there to serve

00:43:26.719 --> 00:43:30.789
 Chinwuba:
  as a deterrent. To capture criminals. But back

00:43:30.789 --> 00:43:34.900
 Chinwuba:
  home we find that there is impunity. People do things.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.940
 Chinwuba:
  Chibok girls disappear. Nothing happened. Dapchi girls disappear.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:44.389
 O'Driscoll:
  Everyday. Everyday. They are come they are going to schools.

00:43:44.389 --> 00:43:50.150
 Chinwuba:
  They are going to schools and kidnapping teachers and students. Everyday.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:54.179
 Chinwuba:
  Which means they don't care. Which means the the government can't catch them. Can't do anything

00:43:54.179 --> 00:43:59.760
 Chinwuba:
  to them. So, many schools are being closed down in Nigeria now because

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.250
 Chinwuba:
  they don't want this. They don't want kidnapping and ransom and all that. Many

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:09.449
 Chinwuba:
  schools. Many people are are are what we call...

00:44:09.449 --> 00:44:15.550
 Chinwuba:
  street children, urchins. They are not getting educated. In the millions.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:20.010
 Chinwuba:
  So, breakdown of law and order is to blame.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:24.119
 Chinwuba:
  The woman, ten women, hundred, two hundred will dissapear. And

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:28.269
 Chinwuba:
  you are negotiating? Sometimes you see goverment negotiating with the bandits.

00:44:28.269 --> 00:44:32.480
 Chinwuba:
  That's one of the problems. As for commodification,

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:37.130
 Chinwuba:
  it's not only women, no, that are being objectified.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:41.570
 Chinwuba:
  It's our consumer society... And our selfish

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:45.920
 Chinwuba:
  society. We only think of ourselves. So

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.940
 Chinwuba:
  I can kill. I can do blood rituals for money.

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:54.389
 Chinwuba:
  I can kill, take another life, to get what I want. So I find that

00:44:54.389 --> 00:45:00.610
 Chinwuba:
  people, men now are also be sold into slavery. Children! Babies. Babies are being

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:04.610
 Chinwuba:
  bought now. See they will just

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:08.789
 Chinwuba:
  go to the grocery shop and they can order babies. Women are held in

00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:12.800
 Chinwuba:
  baby factories where they put ten, twenty women.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.389
 Chinwuba:
  Impregnate them. And then sell the...

00:45:17.389 --> 00:45:21.710
 Chinwuba:
  What of organs? People now...

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:26.210
 Chinwuba:
  people will harvest their organs to give to other people, who are... to be alive.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:31.139
 Chinwuba:
  While the other one dies. So, there is a lot of uh.

00:45:31.139 --> 00:45:35.320
 Chinwuba:
  You know, I think I always say. My my grandmother used to say that the world

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.789
 Chinwuba:
  is going on a journey. We don't know where it will end up. We don't know the timelimess.

00:45:39.789 --> 00:45:44.420
 Chinwuba:
  It keeps moving. New things are coming in that we never saw as kids.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:49.079
 Chinwuba:
  Before as kids we used to play. The whole day you go out in the morning.

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:53.110
 Chinwuba:
  You go to houses. You play. Eveningtime. They send you back home.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:57.199
 Chinwuba:
  Now you can't risk that. Because there are abductors.

00:45:57.199 --> 00:46:02.210
 Chinwuba:
  People can't even send a child on a message. Again. go and buy a coke for me.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:06.460
 Chinwuba:
  No. So things have changed. Society is changing.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:11.369
 Chinwuba:
  And it's because of this consumerist and selfish attitude of of people. That

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:15.699
 Chinwuba:
  everything is now is now a commodity. Everything can be sold.

00:46:15.699 --> 00:46:20.659
 Chinwuba:
  Anything can be sold in order to get by. So that is um.

00:46:20.659 --> 00:46:24.809
 Chinwuba:
  What I have to say about that. As for the writer. Yes.

00:46:24.809 --> 00:46:28.889
 Chinwuba:
  He has to capture this. But he has too much. The powers

00:46:28.889 --> 00:46:32.920
 Chinwuba:
  that be. He has too much the power that be to do something

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.159
 Chinwuba:
  about this. This dislocation in society.

00:46:37.159 --> 00:46:41.610
 Umezurike:
  Thank you very much, Ifeoma, for that sobering response.

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:46.019
 Umezurike:
  And I I think you know we are all implicated one way or another

00:46:46.019 --> 00:46:50.320
 Umezurike:
  in this. The the dysfunctional

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:54.429
 Umezurike:
  system we find ourselves in. Whether it's uh to

00:46:54.429 --> 00:46:58.800
 Umezurike:
  commodify and objectify women or even to sexualize

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.969
 Umezurike:
  men in a way that makes that makes them amenable

00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:06.969
 Umezurike:
  for objectification. And I think it's really important to

00:47:06.969 --> 00:47:11.059
 Umezurike:
  also question our actions and our

00:47:11.059 --> 00:47:15.849
 Umezurike:
  entaglement with

00:47:15.849 --> 00:47:22.519
 Umezurike:
  this sort of system that reinforces

00:47:22.519 --> 00:47:28.510
 Umezurike:
  female subjugation. Male

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:32.929
 Umezurike:
  objectification. And so thank you very much for all these wonderful

00:47:32.929 --> 00:47:37.340
 Umezurike:
  responses. I've been enriched by the conversations

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:41.559
 Umezurike:
  we've been having. And I think this brings me to the final reading. And immediately

00:47:41.559 --> 00:47:46.269
 Umezurike:
  after this I'm going to turn it over to the audience, so they can ask

00:47:46.269 --> 00:47:51.360
 Umezurike:
  questions and uh we we can talk more about some of these intersections

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.469
 Umezurike:
  of ideas in your responses. So, for this

00:47:55.469 --> 00:47:59.550
 Umezurike:
  final reading, I would like

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:03.559
 Umezurike:
  to invite Titilope to go first and then

00:48:03.559 --> 00:48:09.440
 Umezurike:
  Ifeoma will wrap it up. Yeah, okay.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.650
 Sonuga:
  Thank you so much again for all

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:17.829
 Sonuga:
  of it. It's been an honor really to share the space with you.

00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:21.960
 Sonuga:
  For your careful questions and consideration.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.000
 Sonuga:
  I'm in awe of the fact that this is my life and job and I

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.230
 Sonuga:
  get to talk about art and make art for a living. It is a supreme privilege.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:34.559
 Sonuga:
  In the interest of swinging the pendulum towards joy, I actually

00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:39.150
 Sonuga:
  did a poem switch. And I'm gonna do this poem instead.

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:44.019
 Sonuga:
  It is, as yet, untitled. There are prayers,

00:48:44.019 --> 00:48:48.260
 Sonuga:
  generations in the making, that pushed through time to arrive in

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:53.050
 Sonuga:
  the moment of their awakening. That is to say, my presence,

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:57.070
 Sonuga:
  every measure of magic that exists in my life, is likely the answer to

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:01.760
 Sonuga:
  a prayer made at the altar of an ancestor, for whom I only existed

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.059
 Sonuga:
  as a dream. What grace. To be known and loved

00:49:06.059 --> 00:49:10.059
 Sonuga:
  before your birth. Isn't that the history of Blackness across the

00:49:10.059 --> 00:49:15.190
 Sonuga:
  globe? Isn't that the very ingredient of our improbable acts of survival?

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:19.800
 Sonuga:
  That we have always made an offering into a future you will never see.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.860
 Sonuga:
  In our stories, in our song, in our arts, is the prophetic

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:28.409
 Sonuga:
  declaration. That in a time beyond now this gift becomes

00:49:28.409 --> 00:49:32.599
 Sonuga:
  a rope, a hammer, a piece of bread, something

00:49:32.599 --> 00:49:36.639
 Sonuga:
  to build a life. A lighthouse for the children who will

00:49:36.639 --> 00:49:40.809
 Sonuga:
  one day walk this soil. Black as the night sky, we offer them

00:49:40.809 --> 00:49:45.260
 Sonuga:
  the stars to know that we were once here. And how beautiful we were.

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:49.409
 Sonuga:
  How excellent, how brave. We were once here. And beyond our

00:49:49.409 --> 00:49:53.639
 Sonuga:
  magic was a right to ease, to abundance. To a life

00:49:53.639 --> 00:49:57.960
 Sonuga:
  beyond strength and survival. That our rest and refuge

00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:01.969
 Sonuga:
  was worthy of celebration too. And we were black

00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:06.059
 Sonuga:
  every day. On a Monday, when the city stomped the concrete.

00:50:06.059 --> 00:50:10.739
 Sonuga:
  On a Sunday, when the church choirs troubled heaven. Everyday,

00:50:10.739 --> 00:50:15.010
 Sonuga:
  in the face of what threatens to undo us, we are here. A soft

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:19.789
 Sonuga:
  place in a hard world. We make love and we make magic.

00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:24.570
 Sonuga:
  We birth our babies and kiss our elders. We make each day

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:29.489
 Sonuga:
  a ritual of remembering. We create this time capsule

00:50:29.489 --> 00:50:33.909
 Sonuga:
  and offer it to generations, who may never see us, but will know us

00:50:33.909 --> 00:50:38.409
 Sonuga:
  and, thus, know themselves. Thank you.

00:50:38.409 --> 00:50:43.800
 Umezurike:
  Thank you very very much Titilope for these beautiful lines in

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.969
 Umezurike:
  your poetry. And I I just noted down

00:50:47.969 --> 00:50:52.150
 Umezurike:
  a lot of lines, so I can reflect on later on. Uh

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:57.079
 Umezurike:
  so, Ifeoma. Over to you.

00:50:57.079 --> 00:51:01.710
 Chinwuba:
  Thank you, Titilope, for that very nostalgic. You know

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:06.360
 Chinwuba:
  it just takes me back in many years, yeah.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:14.280
 Chinwuba:
  Okay, this. I'm going to read from Waiting for Maria.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:22.289
 Chinwuba:
  As Uche just said already, Maria is a Black Maria that was grounded. And

00:51:22.289 --> 00:51:27.679
 Chinwuba:
  no money to repair it. Couldn't take the inmates to court.

00:51:27.679 --> 00:51:32.050
 Chinwuba:
  Those who were condemned to death and appealed

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:36.269
 Chinwuba:
  didn't know the status of their their cases.

00:51:36.269 --> 00:51:41.869
 Chinwuba:
  So uh, as Uche already said, NGOs,

00:51:41.869 --> 00:51:45.949
 Chinwuba:
  you know charitable organizations, contribute money to repair

00:51:45.949 --> 00:51:50.619
 Chinwuba:
  this vehicle. And it moves and then

00:51:50.619 --> 00:51:56.010
 Chinwuba:
  something happens. And meanwhile some some

00:51:56.010 --> 00:52:02.079
 Chinwuba:
  inmates had been released in a corrupt manner.

00:52:02.079 --> 00:52:06.739
 Chinwuba:
  Because there is what we call amnesty. Once Nigeria had independence

00:52:06.739 --> 00:52:11.239
 Chinwuba:
  Chief George of the magistrate of the head of state grants amnesty

00:52:11.239 --> 00:52:15.260
 Chinwuba:
  to some some prisoners. But the

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.559
 Chinwuba:
  prison warders themselves, it's not free. It goes to the highest

00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:23.699
 Chinwuba:
  bidder. And so she comes and says, bring money and I'll

00:52:23.699 --> 00:52:28.480
 Chinwuba:
  put your name and you get amnesty. So one or two or three people

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:34.739
 Chinwuba:
  got their freedom through that method. And now

00:52:34.739 --> 00:52:39.139
 Chinwuba:
  they know that these humans in there cannot have justice.

00:52:39.139 --> 00:52:43.329
 Chinwuba:
  Cannot have justice. That this is an unjust system. Completely.

00:52:43.329 --> 00:52:47.469
 Chinwuba:
  And that society itself brought them into the into jail

00:52:47.469 --> 00:52:51.599
 Chinwuba:
  to death row. The things that society did and did

00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:56.639
 Chinwuba:
  not do that led them to to this place to this malicious

00:52:56.639 --> 00:53:01.539
 Chinwuba:
  malicious place.

00:53:01.539 --> 00:53:05.570
 Chinwuba:
  And so they they organize a jailbreak.

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:09.650
 Chinwuba:
  And as a jailbreak, they know the topography and geography of the

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:13.710
 Chinwuba:
  Freeman Fort. They know everything, they know that...

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:18.280
 Chinwuba:
  That all the money voted for repairs and rennovations find their way into the

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:22.309
 Chinwuba:
  pocket of the the wardens. And so they

00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:27.070
 Chinwuba:
  think, I'm shackled. I'm dilapidated. And

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:32.920
 Chinwuba:
  easily, you know...

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:38.010
 Chinwuba:
  I'm going to read from the Daily Mirror. It's a newspaper publication.

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:42.139
 Chinwuba:
  The Controller-General of prisons, Mr. Isaac Pam,

00:53:42.139 --> 00:53:47.969
 Chinwuba:
  has been ordered to proceed on a preretirement leave with immediate effect.

00:53:47.969 --> 00:53:52.440
 Chinwuba:
  Sources close to the presidency say this is not unconnected

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:56.800
 Chinwuba:
  with the jailbreak, which occurred in one of the nation's prisons last

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.800
 Chinwuba:
  week. It should be recalled that early last

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.619
 Chinwuba:
  week Freeman Fort was attacked by unknown persons

00:54:05.619 --> 00:54:09.849
 Chinwuba:
  during a period of prolonged blackouts.

00:54:09.849 --> 00:54:13.980
 Chinwuba:
  The aging perimeter walls were easily knocked down,

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:18.119
 Chinwuba:
  enabling the inmates to escape to freedom. Three

00:54:18.119 --> 00:54:23.659
 Chinwuba:
  female guards sustained injuries, nonfatal. The presidency has

00:54:23.659 --> 00:54:28.710
 Chinwuba:
  set up a panel to investigate the incident. The break,

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:32.829
 Chinwuba:
  coming on the heels of the suffocation last week of inmates

00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:37.690
 Chinwuba:
  on their way to court showed a breakdown in the administration

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:42.559
 Chinwuba:
  of the prison service, a government spokesman added.

00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:47.369
 Chinwuba:
  When our reporter contacted the N. B. S. spokesman over the phone,

00:54:47.369 --> 00:54:51.389
 Chinwuba:
  he explained that his boss had been out of the country at the

00:54:51.389 --> 00:54:55.739
 Chinwuba:
  time of the incidents. However,

00:54:55.739 --> 00:54:59.909
 Chinwuba:
  in spite of the telephonic washing of the hands, Mr. Pam is expected

00:54:59.909 --> 00:55:06.820
 Chinwuba:
  to hand over to his Deputy, Mrs. Guyit. That is the...

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.989
 Chinwuba:
  Thank you.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.989
 Umezurike:
  Thank you very much, Ifeoma. Like I mentioned

00:55:10.989 --> 00:55:15.340
 Umezurike:
  earlier I

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:19.880
 Umezurike:
  I like the way you touch on margin. What I call

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:24.230
 Umezurike:
  marginal narratives. And these narratives of people who

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:28.460
 Umezurike:
  female inmates whose condition

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:32.650
 Umezurike:
  certainly would be much worse than

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:37.079
 Umezurike:
  their male counterparts experience because I...

00:55:37.079 --> 00:55:41.750
 Umezurike:
  The the method of imagining someone

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:46.719
 Umezurike:
  in jail, particularly if the person was a male,

00:55:46.719 --> 00:55:51.679
 Umezurike:
  is disturbing as it is. And so to imagine a female

00:55:51.679 --> 00:55:57.280
 Umezurike:
  person living under such gruesome

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:02.840
 Umezurike:
  punishing conditions is something I can't seem to wrap my mind around.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:07.380
 Umezurike:
  And so thank you for narrating that

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:11.389
 Umezurike:
  experience. For giving voice to these voiceless and

00:56:11.389 --> 00:56:16.400
 Umezurike:
  silenced women in an unjust system.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.550
 Umezurike:
  And so I uh. Again I just want to appreciate both

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:25.349
 Umezurike:
  of you for your readings, your discussions, and the insights you've shared

00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:30.110
 Umezurike:
  with me and everyone who is here. And I

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:34.530
 Umezurike:
  I don't want to enjoy all the privilege of asking

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:38.610
 Umezurike:
  you questions. And so I'll open up the space for

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:42.659
 Umezurike:
  people to ask their questions. And please unmute

00:56:42.659 --> 00:56:47.010
 Umezurike:
  your mic if you want to ask a question and

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:52.010
 Umezurike:
  please be concise. Be uh

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:56.280
 Umezurike:
  precise. Just go straight to the point. So other people can have the opportunity of

00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.420
 Umezurike:
  asking questions also.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.420
 Audience 1 :
  I have a question.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:04.610
 Audience 1 :
  Hi, Ifeoma. I've read all your books, and I'm wondering

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:08.699
 Audience 1:
  what you're, what you're currently working on. And what, when to

00:57:08.699 --> 00:57:12.789
 Audience 1:
  expect it because I am a huge fan of yours. I'd like to

00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:16.969
 Audience 1:
  know what you are currently working on. And I really like your smile. It

00:57:16.969 --> 00:57:21.150
 Audience 1:
  just captivates me. I'm just, I'm glad they are taping this thing. Because

00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:25.320
 Audience 1:
  with your smile I can always be happy. Titilope you too, you know.

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:31.230
 Audience 1:
  But I want to. I I have to read your book. But I'm referring this to this question to Ifeoma, currently.

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:35.230
 Chinwuba:
  You know the way writing goes.

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:39.650
 Chinwuba:
  Last time I was in Toronto I I welcomed Professor Soyinka.

00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:43.690
 Chinwuba:
  He came to Toronto. And um I asked him the same

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:48.460
 Chinwuba:
  question. I said, when are we going to expect something from you?

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:55.519
 Chinwuba:
  And he said, ah! When you see it, you take it. As I writer [laughs]. I shouldn't answer that.

00:57:55.519 --> 00:57:59.889
 Chinwuba:
  It depends on the muse, you know. The muse can... You can have writer's

00:57:59.889 --> 00:58:04.940
 Chinwuba:
  block, you know? You have writer's block and then, it appears. That's what writing is.

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:09.070
 Chinwuba:
  So he told me, when you see my next work, you take it.

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:13.880
 Chinwuba:
  The work has come out. The Chronicles from the Happiest People on Earth. So, anyway.

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:18.030
 Chinwuba:
  This program, writer-in-residence program, has given

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:22.329
 Chinwuba:
  me the focus I need to, you know,

00:58:22.329 --> 00:58:26.599
 Chinwuba:
  abjure other things and focus on my work. And I actually have

00:58:26.599 --> 00:58:31.360
 Chinwuba:
  a novel or two in the making. That are, you know, approaching the

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.510
 Chinwuba:
  denouement, if I can put it that way. So I'm

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:39.619
 Chinwuba:
  now looking for an agent and a publisher. So, very soon you will. You will get it. Thank you.

00:58:39.619 --> 00:58:44.179
 Umezurike:
  Thank you very much.

00:58:44.179 --> 00:58:48.250
 Umezurike:
  I'm also looking forward to your next

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:52.940
 Umezurike:
  novel, as well as. I know Titilope is working on something. And if

00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:57.079
 Umezurike:
  she also wants to share just a sneak peek into what you're

00:58:57.079 --> 00:59:01.460
 Umezurike:
  working on. Is there a spoken word album? Is it another

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:05.690
 Umezurike:
  collection that is a follow up to This is How We Disappear?

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:09.820
 Umezurike:
  Or rather now you so much focused on joy, tenderness,

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:14.559
 Umezurike:
  hope, healing. Maybe that's what we should be looking forward to?

00:59:14.559 --> 00:59:18.800
 Sonuga:
  [laughs] It's going to be a surprise to both you and I. [laughs]

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:22.889
 Sonuga:
  Um but I I also almost always have several things going at the same time, which

00:59:22.889 --> 00:59:27.550
 Sonuga:
  isn't necessarily a great uh discipline. But

00:59:27.550 --> 00:59:31.590
 Sonuga:
  definitely a new spoken word album and

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:35.619
 Sonuga:
  definitely another collection. I I'm heading off to a residency in the next

00:59:35.619 --> 00:59:39.909
 Sonuga:
  month um to really streamline some of these ideas.

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:44.139
 Sonuga:
  And and I'm hopeful that brand new the work will come out of there. So, stay

00:59:44.139 --> 00:59:48.610
 Sonuga:
  tuned, I guess, is the short answer to that question.

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:52.719
 Umezurike:
  [laughs] Great! So, more questions

00:59:52.719 --> 00:59:56.829
 Umezurike:
  please for uh Titilope and Ifeoma.

00:59:56.829 --> 01:00:01.110
 O'Driscoll:
  Thanks so much to the three of you. This is... is and continues to be amazing. Just wonderful.

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:05.690
 O'Driscoll:
  Titilope, I have a I have a question for you. I was really struck by

01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:09.739
 O'Driscoll:
  the radical joy that your poetry celebrates. And in particular in the poem you

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:14.300
 O'Driscoll:
  just read it seems to be intergenerational in its force.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:18.860
 O'Driscoll:
  And I was thinking about that in relation to your bringing together

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:23.880
 O'Driscoll:
  of the violence against women both here in Canada and in Nigeria

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.920
 O'Driscoll:
  and the legacies of colonial intergenerational trauma

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.969
 O'Driscoll:
  that perpetuate those systems of violence that threaten to keep us stuck.

01:00:32.969 --> 01:00:37.079
 O'Driscoll:
  Right? That word came up earlier. Am I following you correctly? Is that

01:00:37.079 --> 01:00:41.530
 O'Driscoll:
  then the radical power of joy? That it pushes back across

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:45.610
 O'Driscoll:
  time against the constraints that hold us back

01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:51.780
 O'Driscoll:
  from change? Is that...?

01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:51.780
 Sonuga:
  Yeah, I think um.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.969
 Sonuga:
  We have generations of stories to know that

01:00:55.969 --> 01:01:00.340
 Sonuga:
  the world does what the world does. In its own time. And

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:04.349
 Sonuga:
  I truly do believe that our work as human beings,

01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:08.380
 Sonuga:
  as women and as people, is to

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:12.480
 Sonuga:
  push back against that by saying that I'm alive and I'm here.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.300
 Sonuga:
  And even in all of this I'm still making joy. I'm still making

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:21.309
 Sonuga:
  peace. I'm still making something beautiful. And I think that's what artists do.

01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:25.500
 Sonuga:
  The fact that even with everything that's happening we continue to produce is

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:31.710
 Sonuga:
  that same kind of radical force that says, this is our our work.

01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:35.809
 Sonuga:
  Just by virtue of existing in the world is a is

01:01:35.809 --> 01:01:40.380
 Sonuga:
  a powerful force. And so I applaud and celebrate anyone who is

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:44.500
 Sonuga:
  able to write, paint, create with anything

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.539
 Sonuga:
  in this time. I think that is like an incredible show

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:52.559
 Sonuga:
  of strength. Um and so yeah I guess that's that's that's the

01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:57.250
 Sonuga:
  way that I think about my work and and conversations around

01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:01.369
 Sonuga:
  art. I'm I'm hopeful that in a time beyond, like when I'm no longer

01:02:01.369 --> 01:02:06.070
 Sonuga:
  here, when people look over the work that I created it gives them a sense of

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:10.429
 Sonuga:
  that intergenerational passing down. A sense of that

01:02:10.429 --> 01:02:14.440
 Sonuga:
  people have survived something before this and will continue to survive

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.030
 Sonuga:
  in the future.

01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:23.099
 Umezurike:
  Oh thank you, Mike. So there is a question from Tom. Ifeoma, I wanted you to respond to that first.

01:02:23.099 --> 01:02:27.670
 Umezurike:
  And then Titilope will go immediately after.

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:32.590
 Umezurike:
  So, the question for both of you. The climate crisis

01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:37.269
 Umezurike:
  is having a disproportionate impact on some nations, the poorer

01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:41.440
 Umezurike:
  more than the affluent. At least so far. Has this

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.570
 Umezurike:
  crisis had an effect on your creative

01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:49.610
 Umezurike:
  work or your thinking as a writer? That's

01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:53.820
 Umezurike:
  like what's the relationship between the climate crisis

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:58.289
 Umezurike:
  and your your creative practices.

01:02:58.289 --> 01:03:02.650
 Chinwuba:
  Well, thank you for that question. Um, I think some

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:06.929
 Chinwuba:
  poems, which I write on past events on Plateau.

01:03:06.929 --> 01:03:11.510
 Chinwuba:
  Um. And um.

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:16.030
 Chinwuba:
  It was as a result of desertification

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:21.369
 Chinwuba:
  back home in Nigeria. And a movement of nomadic

01:03:21.369 --> 01:03:25.570
 Chinwuba:
  herdsmen with their cattle in search of water, in search of grazing

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:30.059
 Chinwuba:
  fields for their their their herds.

01:03:30.059 --> 01:03:34.949
 Chinwuba:
  And in so doing, because they made the pastor and the farmers,

01:03:34.949 --> 01:03:39.030
 Chinwuba:
  and uh trouble broke out. Because they were going to fight

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:43.179
 Chinwuba:
  over resources, over grass. If somebody is a farmer planting

01:03:43.179 --> 01:03:47.570
 Chinwuba:
  crops. And you you come with animals that eat crops,

01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:53.550
 Chinwuba:
  there's bound to be conflict. So, I've written some poems, you know to

01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:57.679
 Chinwuba:
  in answer to that. In answer to the desert...

01:03:57.679 --> 01:04:02.190
 Chinwuba:
  Back home in Africa our experience of climate change

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:06.500
 Chinwuba:
  is the drying up. For instance, the

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:11.130
 Chinwuba:
  heating and all. Is the drying up of the...

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:15.320
 Chinwuba:
  And so cattle movement down south is. And it's war. And its

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.860
 Chinwuba:
  very. Its uh its uh it's lots of bloodletting. It's not just stop here.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:24.409
 Chinwuba:
  Go here. They they kill. They decimate people.

01:04:24.409 --> 01:04:29.210
 Chinwuba:
  And the nature of their culture. Nature of their practices.

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:33.429
 Chinwuba:
  These people are monogomous. You are polygamous. So, if we allow you to stay,

01:04:33.429 --> 01:04:37.500
 Chinwuba:
  in the next generation you may come for us. So, it's a...

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.840
 Chinwuba:
  It's a do or die affair. And so, I've captured some of these uh.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.989
 Chinwuba:
  These aspects of the climate change, desertification, in

01:04:45.989 --> 01:04:50.250
 Chinwuba:
  some of the poems I've written in the Plateau State where

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:55.309
 Chinwuba:
  a lot of these...

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:59.940
 Chinwuba:
  battle has errupted. And then back home

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:04.019
 Chinwuba:
  too in sources of engery. How are we men still

01:05:04.019 --> 01:05:08.449
 Chinwuba:
  dependent on trees? Dependent on fire wood

01:05:08.449 --> 01:05:12.659
 Chinwuba:
  to cook, smoke, and all. So, I've captured that in some of my

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:17.829
 Chinwuba:
  writings. But um...

01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:22.519
 Chinwuba:
  But most cannot dichotomize the effects of the climate change between here and there.

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:27.159
 Chinwuba:
  Because it's one world. It's one globe. Whatever happens over there

01:05:27.159 --> 01:05:31.239
 Chinwuba:
  eventually effects us here. If I go look at Edmonton.

01:05:31.239 --> 01:05:37.699
 Chinwuba:
  The middle of winter. We are having nine degrees! Ten degrees! And I'm asking.

01:05:37.699 --> 01:05:44.300
 Chinwuba:
  What is going on here? Is this winter? Is this how my idea of winter is in Edmonton? And they say, don't be decieved. We have fluctuations.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:48.429
 Chinwuba:
  So, it effects everybody, climate change. Whether in Europe, in

01:05:48.429 --> 01:05:53.039
 Chinwuba:
  American, or in African. And you cannot, you

01:05:53.039 --> 01:05:57.150
 Chinwuba:
  cannot say, it's in Africa. How is it in America? How is it? Because it's one

01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:01.159
 Chinwuba:
  world. What affects you here eventually affects

01:06:01.159 --> 01:06:05.360
 Chinwuba:
  the other person. So in our writing, in my writing, I've tried to capture

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.900
 Chinwuba:
  it in the poems and in the the culture

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:13.920
 Chinwuba:
  that I describe in my books. Thank you. I hope I've answered and given insight.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.019
 Audience 2:
  Thank you. That was a wonderful answer.

01:06:18.019 --> 01:06:22.039
 Audience 2:
  I I totally agree that we need to share these stories about

01:06:22.039 --> 01:06:26.190
 Audience 2:
  what's happening all over the world, right? It's coming together and communicating that

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:30.420
 Audience 2:
  this way that is really going to make people realize

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:34.969
 Audience 2:
  what's going on and how urgent it is. So, thank you, yeah.

01:06:34.969 --> 01:06:39.429
 Umezurike:
  Um Titilope, I think you should also answer that.

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:43.519
 Sonuga:
  Um a poet friend of mine by the name of Brandon Wint has this

01:06:43.519 --> 01:06:47.599
 Sonuga:
  interesting take on how

01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:51.889
 Sonuga:
  the climate crisis is an extension

01:06:51.889 --> 01:06:55.940
 Sonuga:
  of this great colonial projects, right? And and as a result

01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:00.269
 Sonuga:
  of that Blackness and Black people are very closely

01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:04.369
 Sonuga:
  related to this idea of the ways in which men have always

01:07:04.369 --> 01:07:08.420
 Sonuga:
  wanted to conquer the earth and conquer other people. And it is a result of

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:12.510
 Sonuga:
  that conquering that this crisis emerges, right? I think

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:16.699
 Sonuga:
  it's it's very interesting and something that I I've been ruminating over.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:20.900
 Sonuga:
  Um, while I don't specifically talk about the climate climate

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:25.110
 Sonuga:
  crisis in my work, I do think what is central to the work that I write is

01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:29.269
 Sonuga:
  this connection to nature. You will always hear something up about

01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:33.289
 Sonuga:
  the land and the trees and the water in my work, the ways. And

01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:37.599
 Sonuga:
  those things are intentional because I think um we

01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:42.039
 Sonuga:
  are so deeply connected to the earth that it is not removed from us.

01:07:42.039 --> 01:07:46.289
 Sonuga:
  And so when I'm writing I I tried to bring a sense of honor

01:07:46.289 --> 01:07:52.570
 Sonuga:
  to to those ideas.

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:56.690
 Sonuga:
  Um, yeah and I think it may be in the subtlety of that is an acknowledgement that

01:07:56.690 --> 01:08:00.860
 Sonuga:
  there's something to be preserved and honored and cared

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:05.559
 Sonuga:
  for in that. And by caring for eachother and ourselves,

01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:09.860
 Sonuga:
  it bleeds over into the ways that we care for the earth that we live on. And so if,

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.889
 Sonuga:
  all of those things, I guess I'm saying, are interconnected. Thank you.

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:18.078
 Audience 2:
  Thank you, yeah. I I agree. I think that's the hopeful part of it, right? Is is

01:08:18.078 --> 01:08:22.109
 Audience 2:
  that connection to nature and and the realization that we we we are

01:08:22.109 --> 01:08:26.770
 Audience 2:
   nothing without nature. So, yeah, thank you.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:30.788
 Audience 3:
  Thank you so much, Titilope and Ifeoma. Really appreciate the words that you

01:08:30.788 --> 01:08:34.880
 Audience 3:
  shared today. And for taking the time out to share great

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.149
 Audience 3:
  literature with us so early in the year.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:43.649
 Audience 3:
  My question is around, um,

01:08:43.649 --> 01:08:47.810
 Audience 3:
  actually for both of you, all three of you, kind of where you see, uh,

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:51.948
 Audience 3:
  African literature, Nigerian literature going. And to sort of frame that

01:08:51.948 --> 01:08:56.038
 Audience 3:
  question, um. In this conversation there's been many sort of

01:08:56.038 --> 01:09:00.738
 Audience 3:
  mention of other writers. Whether it's Chinua, Wole Soyinka, um,

01:09:00.738 --> 01:09:04.779
 Audience 3:
  contemporary African writers. For me someone like Teju Cole. And so

01:09:04.779 --> 01:09:08.908
 Audience 3:
  I I feel like there is at this time. There isn't like a shortlist of

01:09:08.908 --> 01:09:13.029
 Audience 3:
  Nigerian writers throughout the world. You find that there are Nigerians doing great

01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:17.300
 Audience 3:
  literature throughout the world and have been doing so. And for the younger

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:21.340
 Audience 3:
  generation I would also say that most recently you had

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:25.359
 Audience 3:
  just the explosion of a music, Nigerian music and afrobeats

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:29.460
 Audience 3:
  and afropop, whether its Wizkid, Burna Boy. So, there's, there really has

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:33.840
 Audience 3:
  been in my eyes sort of this uh spotlight

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:38.118
 Audience 3:
  on Nigerian culture and really the impact of Nigerian culture in so many different realms.

01:09:38.118 --> 01:09:42.198
 Audience 3:
  Uche, you mentioned Nollywood and how Nollywood

01:09:42.198 --> 01:09:46.220
 Audience 3:
  has even impacted. Not impacted. But sort of

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:50.220
 Audience 3:
  been spotlighted in things in like

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:54.550
 Audience 3:
  Netflix. So, I feel like there are so many different avenues

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:58.560
 Audience 3:
  to sort of tap into Nigerian culture. And I think in the way

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:03.569
 Audience 3:
  that we are connected now there's also a very stark line of

01:10:03.569 --> 01:10:07.600
 Audience 3:
  what came before, what is now, and you know what is

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.829
 Audience 3:
  to come. And so it's just to kind of frame it again to say there's

01:10:11.829 --> 01:10:16.470
 Audience 3:
  so many different examples of new contemporary Nigerian

01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:20.569
 Audience 3:
  art. And I'm I'm going to ask both of you kind of where

01:10:20.569 --> 01:10:25.319
 Audience 3:
  do you see yourselves as uh. Where do you see Nigerian literature

01:10:25.319 --> 01:10:29.470
 Audience 3:
  sort of heading towards. Um if you could give us maybe some some themes that

01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:34.149
 Audience 3:
  you have been able to observe.

01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:38.229
 Chinwuba:
  Thank you so much for that question. Yes, you are right

01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:42.760
 Chinwuba:
  to observe that um Nigerian art and

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:47.180
 Chinwuba:
  culture are growing in leaps and bounds.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:51.199
 Chinwuba:
  Not just Nigerian, too. Last year we had almost all the

01:10:51.199 --> 01:10:55.890
 Chinwuba:
  prizes won by Africans. All the major literary prizes

01:10:55.890 --> 01:11:00.300
 Chinwuba:
  from the Nobel to the Booker to... All won by

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:04.840
 Chinwuba:
  Africans. So, it's like the world is waking up now too. It's opening

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:10.050
 Chinwuba:
  the gate to let in new ideas and new um

01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:14.520
 Chinwuba:
  new cultures. You see? So in Nigeria

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.079
 Chinwuba:
  this, as you also pointed out, it's not just in the in writing.

01:11:19.079 --> 01:11:23.100
 Chinwuba:
  In literature. It's also there in the music.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.300
 Chinwuba:
  There in Nollywood. It's there in dance. Everything!

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.529
 Chinwuba:
  And, um, I think the reason for this is the social media. It's always

01:11:31.529 --> 01:11:36.010
 Chinwuba:
  been very prolific in Nigeria.

01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:41.199
 Chinwuba:
  It's always been very very prolific, right? From my school days we have Nigerian poets.

01:11:41.199 --> 01:11:45.739
 Chinwuba:
  So many of them. But now with social media

01:11:45.739 --> 01:11:50.050
 Chinwuba:
  the world is just. At a click you

01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:54.520
 Chinwuba:
  can read poems from all over the world. You can see people.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:58.689
 Chinwuba:
  You can see artists. You can watch movies from Nigeria. Everywhere! So,

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:02.890
 Chinwuba:
  the the creativity has always been there in my view.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:08.390
 Chinwuba:
  Now with the social media, the publicity is is following.

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:13.060
 Chinwuba:
  And um it's a a cross-

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:18.090
 Chinwuba:
  fertilization of ideas, as well. Because Nollywood is growing. Because at their fingertips

01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:22.680
 Chinwuba:
  they have Hollywood. They have Bollywood. They have other experiences.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:27.779
 Chinwuba:
  And so they are able to see what is happening there. And say, why can't I do this?

01:12:27.779 --> 01:12:32.640
 Chinwuba:
  Why can't I replicate this? This is in Bollywood in India. We can do this as well.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:36.699
 Chinwuba:
  And so people are tuning in and um

01:12:36.699 --> 01:12:40.989
 Chinwuba:
  hearing music. People who under normal circumstances would not have

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:45.579
 Chinwuba:
  access to to you know

01:12:45.579 --> 01:12:49.630
 Chinwuba:
  to a producer. They they are producing. They are producing and pushing it out

01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:54.539
 Chinwuba:
  on the internet. And so you have to reckon with them. Tiktok...

01:12:54.539 --> 01:12:58.609
 Chinwuba:
  and they push it out. So, you are seeing them more.

01:12:58.609 --> 01:13:03.270
 Chinwuba:
  But they've always be there. Another thing that I I

01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:08.399
 Chinwuba:
  came across was, you know, almost illiterate children in Nigeria.

01:13:08.399 --> 01:13:14.010
 Chinwuba:
  Now they make a plane. And they fly it. They they tweak it, and the thing

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:20.560
 Chinwuba:
  takes off and lands maybe a hundred metres away.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.729
 Chinwuba:
  They make a car. They make all sorts of gadgets. They make a bicycle. And they

01:13:24.729 --> 01:13:29.720
 Chinwuba:
  are illiterate. They have not been to school. You see? They have always been there, but now

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.750
 Chinwuba:
  with the social media they are coming into the limelight. And they are saying, oh!

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:37.979
 Chinwuba:
  There's a lot of this. There is a lot of that. But it's always been there.

01:13:37.979 --> 01:13:42.560
 Chinwuba:
  As I say, we grew up with storytelling. Storytelling has been [snaps fingers] with us. And

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:47.239
 Chinwuba:
  so, we pass it on from one generation to the other. And as we pass it on

01:13:47.239 --> 01:13:51.460
 Chinwuba:
  we add. As we say, we add salt and pepper, you know? We add

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:56.180
 Chinwuba:
  things to it. But now with social media, again Tiktok,

01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:00.239
 Chinwuba:
  and you know Whatsapp. You create something and you push it out,

01:14:00.239 --> 01:14:04.590
 Chinwuba:
  and the world says, wow! There is a recrudescence of these things. But they have always been there, in my view.

01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:08.949
 Sonuga:
  First I'll say that I think there's

01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:12.970
 Sonuga:
  an audacity and pride with which Nigerians enter every space

01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:17.640
 Sonuga:
  that they're in. I think it is one of our greatest gifts, and I think that makes it so

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:22.619
 Sonuga:
  we enter spaces and we,

01:14:22.619 --> 01:14:27.029
 Sonuga:
  you know, we dominate [laughs]. But

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:31.340
 Sonuga:
  I will say that I completely with what Ifeoma said about the reason.

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:36.420
 Sonuga:
  There's, there's sort of a democratization of sharing and voices,

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:40.569
 Sonuga:
  um, that's happened with social media. And just the the the more

01:14:40.569 --> 01:14:44.909
 Sonuga:
  connected way that the world is. In I think in in in

01:14:44.909 --> 01:14:49.210
 Sonuga:
  past generations there was this idea that there was one, only room for one

01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:53.399
 Sonuga:
  literary star. One African, one Nigerian

01:14:53.399 --> 01:14:57.850
 Sonuga:
  literary star. And as such you had... it was like cycles

01:14:57.850 --> 01:15:01.960
 Sonuga:
  of one person per time could really occupy the space. And and the kinds of stories that were being

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.380
 Sonuga:
  told had to sit within a certain kind of space

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:10.420
 Sonuga:
  to be, um, noticed and to be celebrated. Now, because

01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:14.460
 Sonuga:
  we're now in a space where everyone's voices can be

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:18.569
 Sonuga:
  heard everywhere in in real time, I

01:15:18.569 --> 01:15:23.060
 Sonuga:
  think a lot, I'm talking about literature in particular now, that a lot of young Nigerian

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.390
 Sonuga:
  writers now have the freedom to write about just about anything.

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:32.409
 Sonuga:
  You know like there are new generations of of young Nigerian writers who are writing

01:15:32.409 --> 01:15:36.760
 Sonuga:
  magical realism. Who are writing whatever. Like whatever

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.000
 Sonuga:
  the mind can touch they're creating this work. Because now it feels like there's space.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.430
 Sonuga:
  Like the sky is big enough for all the stars to exist at the same time. And

01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:49.520
 Sonuga:
  and I think that's why we're seeing such diverse diversity of thoughts happening it

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.640
 Sonuga:
  seems at a fever pitch. Happening all at the same time. Um, where

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.890
 Sonuga:
  do I see Nigerian literature? All, anywhere that it chooses.

01:15:57.890 --> 01:16:02.029
 Sonuga:
  You know I think I'm really excited about some forthcoming work. And

01:16:02.029 --> 01:16:06.939
 Sonuga:
  and work that is bending, turning language on its head

01:16:06.939 --> 01:16:11.439
 Sonuga:
  and coming up with new ideas.

01:16:11.439 --> 01:16:15.579
 Sonuga:
  And telling stories that we haven't seen before. So, I think I think it

01:16:15.579 --> 01:16:19.659
 Sonuga:
  is limitless. I'm I'm excited about the idea that... I mean,

01:16:19.659 --> 01:16:24.590
 Sonuga:
  even the idea of publishing in the traditional sense is evolving.

01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:28.630
 Sonuga:
  Some writers self publish, and that's not such a horrible thing

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:32.729
 Sonuga:
  anymore, you know? And you know now we have audio books and we can

01:16:32.729 --> 01:16:37.369
 Sonuga:
  hear writers actually read and speak their words out loud. I think the possibilities

01:16:37.369 --> 01:16:42.899
 Sonuga:
  are quite endless. And I think it's it it's an exciting time

01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:47.090
 Sonuga:
  for the culture generally.

01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:51.149
 Umezurike:
  There are two questions. One from... How would you define your poetic style? That's

01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:55.180
 Umezurike:
  for you. And then there's a question for both of you from Carlo

01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:59.600
 Umezurike:
  who is asking, besides

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.609
 Umezurike:
  publishing what are other plans and programs you have to propogate

01:17:03.609 --> 01:17:07.680
 Umezurike:
  the suggestions found in your works through some of the people who

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:12.029
 Umezurike:
  should really hear them. The people I mean here are those who are really

01:17:12.029 --> 01:17:16.159
 Umezurike:
  affected by some of these issues addressed both in reference to culture and politics.

01:17:16.159 --> 01:17:20.659
 Sonuga:
  My poetic style

01:17:20.659 --> 01:17:25.510
 Sonuga:
  is [laughs] whatever is in the season that I'm in in that moment.

01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:30.319
 Sonuga:
  Um, I don't I don't define that style. And I don't

01:17:30.319 --> 01:17:34.420
 Sonuga:
  I don't think about that very deeply. I just move in the direction of

01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:38.510
 Sonuga:
  what kind of work feels urgent to me in that time, which is why I

01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:42.520
 Sonuga:
  write for the page. I write for the stage. I do spoken word albums. And I think

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:47.170
 Sonuga:
  the work of a an artist or poet is expansive. And we can do all the things. So,

01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:51.319
 Sonuga:
  um, I guess maybe the the short answer is, I don't know. I just create

01:17:51.319 --> 01:17:55.550
 Sonuga:
  what what feels good to me in that moment. Um,

01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:59.909
 Sonuga:
  and in in continuance of that to the other question

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:04.260
 Sonuga:
  I think art is expansive. Like I don't I don't think just publishing

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:08.760
 Sonuga:
  for the page in enough. I agree. I think both of us

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.850
 Sonuga:
  um, have, like perform our work and speak our work

01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:16.869
 Sonuga:
  out loud. And allow that work to exist in many different forms. And

01:18:16.869 --> 01:18:21.619
 Sonuga:
  I think that's part of getting, of allowing the work to have reach,

01:18:21.619 --> 01:18:25.619
 Sonuga:
  you know? Yeah, I do I perform on the stage

01:18:25.619 --> 01:18:30.090
 Sonuga:
  for this very reason. And I perform across the world, um,

01:18:30.090 --> 01:18:34.750
 Sonuga:
  because I also believe in the power of the spoken word. Hearing the words out loud.

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:39.590
 Sonuga:
  Because um books are also a privileged thing.

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:43.670
 Sonuga:
  Not everybody can own a book. Read a book.

01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:47.989
 Sonuga:
  But I think there's something in the physical experience of

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:52.020
 Sonuga:
  a performance that is that is accessible. And I guess I'm just trying

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:56.069
 Sonuga:
  to evolve my work into many different mediums such that it has as much reach

01:18:56.069 --> 01:19:00.149
 Sonuga:
  and can touch as many people as possible.

01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:04.430
 Umezurike:
  Yeah, thank you very much, Titilope. Ifeoma you can

01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:08.680
 Umezurike:
  take a stab at that question.

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:12.880
 Chinwuba:
  Okay, what are we doing to nudge the the people, the culture, and the

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.899
 Chinwuba:
  politics? Well, well,

01:19:16.899 --> 01:19:21.260
 Chinwuba:
  well, well, well, well. Um, whatever we

01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:25.260
 Chinwuba:
  write, what, write put in a book is

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:29.609
 Chinwuba:
  already there in the public space.

01:19:29.609 --> 01:19:33.670
 Chinwuba:
  And our people say that uh no deafer person than person who does not want

01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:38.850
 Chinwuba:
  to hear. And so somebody who does not want to hear.

01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:43.409
 Chinwuba:
  Oh, he can hear. He has the ability to hear. But he does not want to hear. That's the deaf...

01:19:43.409 --> 01:19:47.630
 Chinwuba:
  That's deafest person you have. So all this age we are talking about in books.

01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:52.050
 Chinwuba:
  That we are writing in books. That we have chronicling. They are already there.

01:19:52.050 --> 01:19:57.460
 Chinwuba:
  Government is aware. It's already in social media, if you like. In newspapers.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:01.500
 Chinwuba:
  Most of my, most of the things I write are,

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:05.720
 Chinwuba:
  for instance, I gather from newspapers.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:09.939
 Chinwuba:
  What goes on. What people are doing. For instance, you read about ritual killing.

01:20:09.939 --> 01:20:14.199
 Chinwuba:
  Somebody even lured his mother to a hotel room and tried to

01:20:14.199 --> 01:20:18.350
 Chinwuba:
  stab her to use her for a ritual killing. It's all... it's there

01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:22.670
 Chinwuba:
  in the papers. So, if I put it in my, in my book,

01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:27.619
 Chinwuba:
  for instance, it's a narrative fiction. It's to capture the zeitgeist. The

01:20:27.619 --> 01:20:32.430
 Chinwuba:
  times that we are living in. But government is aware.

01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:37.479
 Chinwuba:
  The police is aware. Women are aware. Even as it happens

01:20:37.479 --> 01:20:41.550
 Chinwuba:
  you see people reacting. What is the world coming to? Hold

01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:45.859
 Chinwuba:
  your children? Hold this... So the reactions

01:20:45.859 --> 01:20:49.920
 Chinwuba:
  are there. And government is there. And if government wants to do something,

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.489
 Chinwuba:
  government can. And I think the solution, one of the soutions.

01:20:54.489 --> 01:20:58.760
 Chinwuba:
  People keep saying, you must have strong institutions. You must have strong

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:03.619
 Chinwuba:
  institutions. That's what we lack.

01:21:03.619 --> 01:21:08.460
 Chinwuba:
  We'd rather have strong personalities. You cannot. You cannot

01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:15.140
 Chinwuba:
  write something critical of the president or the governor or those in power. You cannot.

01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:19.449
 Chinwuba:
  So, we don't have the strong institutions to to tackle these problems.

01:21:19.449 --> 01:21:24.449
 Chinwuba:
  These social problems. But they know already that the problems are there.

01:21:24.449 --> 01:21:28.670
 Chinwuba:
  They cannot claim that they do not know. They know that there are

01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:34.569
 Chinwuba:
  urchins, street urchins. How many millions of children are out of school? They know!

01:21:34.569 --> 01:21:40.710
 Chinwuba:
  They see them hawking. As they are going to work, they see children nine, ten, eleven

01:21:40.710 --> 01:21:46.720
 Chinwuba:
  selling... on the road, selling bananas on the road. And they should be in school.

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:53.529
 Chinwuba:
  So? The deafest person is the person who does not want to hear.

01:21:53.529 --> 01:21:58.000
 Chinwuba:
  Government is aware of these problems. If government wants to do something

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.260
 Chinwuba:
  it can do something. But as

01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:06.590
 Chinwuba:
  as a writer to capture it in our stories.

01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:11.060
 Chinwuba:
  This is what is happening. There's... I think wrote her memoirs.

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:15.239
 Chinwuba:
  I thought it stranger than fiction.

01:22:15.239 --> 01:22:19.600
 Chinwuba:
  Some of the things we write. Some of the things happening back home.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:25.920
 Chinwuba:
  When people here read them here they think... it's not possible, is this? But they are happening!

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:31.050
 Chinwuba:
  You see? So the writer is to capture it and put it there. So then ten, twenty, thirty,

01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:35.899
 Chinwuba:
  fifty years. People come and say hm, this is what, this is what was happening there?

01:22:35.899 --> 01:22:41.350
 Chinwuba:
  Yes! And government is aware. Government is there. Bandits are coming

01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:46.289
 Chinwuba:
  and kidnapping girls. What have they done about Chibok? What have they done about Dapchi?

01:22:46.289 --> 01:22:51.340
 Chinwuba:
  No? They are there. And the bandits have their mobile

01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:56.119
 Chinwuba:
  phones and... you you can't even get them through your mobile phones?

01:22:56.119 --> 01:23:00.250
 Chinwuba:
  So, government is aware. Yesterday, they are closing schools. Ah, they say security is

01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:04.569
 Chinwuba:
  too much. Ah, please, close your school, so that they don't come and cap-please!

01:23:04.569 --> 01:23:08.800
 Chinwuba:
  Close your schools. Is that what government should do? Should government close

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.260
 Chinwuba:
  the schools? Or go after the bandits?

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:17.649
 Chinwuba:
  So, you have the whole area. So many children are out of school.

01:23:17.649 --> 01:23:21.859
 Chinwuba:
  Because government has closed schools due to insecurity. But you are supposed

01:23:21.859 --> 01:23:26.399
 Chinwuba:
  to provide security! So, we writers we capture

01:23:26.399 --> 01:23:31.689
 Chinwuba:
  the the thing. You chronicle it. As we see it. As it's happening.

01:23:31.689 --> 01:23:36.550
 Chinwuba:
  But let the government not claim that they are not aware, not aware.

01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:40.579
 Chinwuba:
  You are aware! It's happening there. You read the papers, you see it.

01:23:40.579 --> 01:23:45.470
 Chinwuba:
  You are aware. Do something. Wake up! Do something.

01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:49.609
 Chinwuba:
  That's why the last, um, the last demonstration we had was called

01:23:49.609 --> 01:23:54.329
 Chinwuba:
  sorosoke. Speak up. Speak to power. Speak truth to power.

01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:58.989
 Chinwuba:
  So, that's what I can say. As a writer, you write. And then leave it to

01:23:58.989 --> 01:24:03.229
 Chinwuba:
  those have the means to act. Thank you.

01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:07.489
 Umezurike:
  Thank you very much, Ifeoma and Titilope

01:24:07.489 --> 01:24:12.699
 Umezurike:
  for those insights and responses.

01:24:12.699 --> 01:24:16.779
 Umezurike:
  We are almost exceeding our

01:24:16.779 --> 01:24:21.720
 Umezurike:
  time here. And although there is a question

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:25.750
 Umezurike:
  for Titilope, but I think... Titilope

01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:30.069
 Umezurike:
  if you are disposed to answering those questions or one of the

01:24:30.069 --> 01:24:34.079
 Umezurike:
  questions, uh uh you can.

01:24:34.079 --> 01:24:38.310
 Umezurike:
  Or... can reach out to you. And

01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:42.750
 Umezurike:
  I don't know how you want to take that. But we have to... in the next few

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:48.689
 Umezurike:
  seconds we should be rounding off.

01:24:48.689 --> 01:24:52.859
 Umezurike:
  Titilope, do you want to respond to that or?

01:24:52.859 --> 01:24:56.869
 Sonuga:
  Yes, I can do it quickly. Yes, my work is absolutely influenced by oral traditions. That is the tradition I grew up

01:24:56.869 --> 01:25:00.970
 Sonuga:
  in. All of us had aunties and mummies who would come into the room and command the space just

01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:05.310
 Sonuga:
  by telling a story. And so that is where I was raised. And that's where I I

01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:09.680
 Sonuga:
  will remain. As for poetry collections, Maggie Smith, Good Bones.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.899
 Sonuga:
  Warsan Shire, um Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth. And in

01:25:13.899 --> 01:25:18.159
 Sonuga:
  her upcoming collection, which I've not read but I'm already recommending, it's called Praise

01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:22.210
 Sonuga:
  the Daughter Who Raised, uh Who Raised Herself With the Voice in Her Head

01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:26.489
 Sonuga:
  or something like that. Anything Warsan writes read it. Um Claudia Rankine, Citizen.

01:25:26.489 --> 01:25:30.520
 Sonuga:
  The list is endless. But you can reach out to me offline, and I will chat with

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:34.640
 Sonuga:
  you some more.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:39.010
 Umezurike:
  Thank you very much. Once again I just want to say thank you

 Umezurike:
  want to encourage you to have these conversations in other spaces.

01:26:08.079 --> 01:26:13.100
 Umezurike:
  To reach out to Titilope and

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:17.119
